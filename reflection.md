What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Using 'self' allowed me to use dot notation to get attibutes of particular objects in a class.

I originally had the price, veresion, and age of the computer all put into the computer class thinking that the values belonged there because they all involved characteristics of the computer itself, but the price ended up being important for the resale shop class instead considering the buy and sell functions involved price and were not in the computer class. This was a small change that was a big help with understanding how the functions were connected to eachother.

I'd recommend taking time to really study and learn exactly what classes, attributes, and methods are. For me that was the very first obstacle I had to get over when completing the homework, and once you figure it out it gives your program more structure and your thought process a sequence to make it feel less confusing.
